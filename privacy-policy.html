        <h2>5. WHAT IS OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING?</h2>
        <p>In certain countries we are required to have a legal basis for collecting and using your personal information. Our legal basis will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need your information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your fundamental rights. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the details provided in the "Contact Us" section below.</p>

        <h2>6. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>We may share your personal information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With vendors, consultants, and other service providers who process your personal information on our behalf when they provide services to us, for example data analytics, research, marketing and financial services.</li>
            <li>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may be legally required to disclose or share your personal information without your consent in some circumstances, for example to comply with a court order or law enforcement. In such circumstances, we will only disclose your personal information if we have a good-faith belief that such sharing is required under applicable legal obligations.</p>

        <h2>7. YOUR MARKETING CHOICES</h2>
        <p>When you sign up for a promotion like a sweepstakes, or subscribe to receive our newsletter or marketing/promotional messages, we use your personal information to help us decide which products, services and offers may be of interest to you.</p>
        <p>We will send marketing messages to you if you have asked us to send you information, bought goods or services from us, or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion. If you opt out of receiving marketing messages, we may still send you non-promotional emails. We will ask for your consent before we share your personal information with any third party for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>You may unsubscribe from marketing messages through a link we include on messages we send you. You can also ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:info@901consulting.net">info@901consulting.net</a>.</p>

        <h2>8. RETENTION OF YOUR DATA AND DELETION</h2>
        <p>Your personal information will not be kept longer than is necessary for the specific purpose for which it was collected.</p>
        <p>When we decide how long we will keep your information we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, why we need it, and any relevant legal requirements (such as legal retention and destruction periods).</p>
        <p>The foregoing will, however, not prevent us from retaining any personal information if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, in order to file a legal claim or defend ourselves against a legal claim, or for evidential purposes.</p>
        <p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available from us on request by contacting us using the contact details provided under the "Contact Us" heading below.</p>

        <h2>9. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
